# Deployment Checklist - Pre-Launch Improvements

## Features Added
- ✅ Rate limiting for auth endpoints (5 attempts/15 min)
- ✅ Rate limiting for API endpoints (100 req/hour per user)
- ✅ Loading states for all operations
- ✅ Structured error logging with monitoring
- ✅ User feedback mechanism (floating button)
- ✅ Error boundary for graceful error handling

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Backend Changes
- [x] Added express-rate-limit package
- [x] Created rate limiting middleware
- [x] Added structured logging system
- [x] Track auth events and API response times
- [x] Applied rate limiters to all routes

### Frontend Changes
- [x] Added feedback modal and button
- [x] Created error boundary component
- [x] Updated app metadata
- [x] Integrated feedback system in dashboard

### Environment Variables Needed
- Existing env vars should work as-is
- No new environment variables required

### Railway Deployment Notes
- Rate limiting will help prevent abuse
- Logs will be structured JSON in production
- Health endpoint remains unchanged

### Vercel Deployment Notes
- Error boundary will catch React errors
- Feedback currently logs to console (can be enhanced later)
- All CORS origins already configured

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add pre-launch improvements: rate limiting, monitoring, and user feedback"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Railway** (Backend):
   - Will auto-deploy from GitHub push
   - Monitor logs for any issues
   - Test rate limiting on live endpoints

4. **Vercel** (Frontend):
   - Will auto-deploy from GitHub push
   - Verify feedback button appears
   - Test error boundary behavior

## Post-Deployment Testing

1. Test rate limiting:
   - Try 6 failed login attempts
   - Verify 429 error after 5 attempts

2. Test feedback system:
   - Click feedback button
   - Submit test feedback
   - Check browser console for logged feedback

3. Test error logging:
   - Monitor Railway logs for structured output
   - Verify auth events are tracked

4. Test loading states:
   - All operations should show spinners
   - No UI freezing during operations
